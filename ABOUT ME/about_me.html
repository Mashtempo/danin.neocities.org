            <p>★ Danin ★ 18 (08.02.2006) ★ he/him ★ autistic ★ Bosnian (sorry) ★</p> <br>
            <p>Hello there! Name's Danin. I'm a high school student from Bosnia, currently studying I.T. (oh, and
                that birthday date is dd/mm/yyyy fyi)
            </p>
            <p>I am mostly known by my username, Mashtempo. A name that originated by me combining two of my (at the time)
                favourite genres - mashcore and uptempo. I still enjoy them, but my music taste changes more time I change 
                my socks.  
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy programming and turning all of my stupid and silly ideas into reality. This site is a prime example of
                this. I'm a big fan of retro technology and games and I absolutely ADORE 90s-00s sites. So, I wanted to recreate 
                that feel for my own site. Albeit my HTML and CSS knowledge isn't that great (and I refuse to learn them properly)
                I mostly use C (and I also refuse to learn Rust) for side projects, while using C++, Kotlin, PHP and Javascript 
                (bruh) for school. 
            </p>
            <p>Most of my free time is spent creating content on YouTube, tho. I always liked making stories ever since I started
                to learn how to write, and editing is a skill I picked up recently (around when COVID started) because I was
                bored out of my mind and just wanted to learn it. I combined these two skills to create YouTube videos on the
                channel Mashtempo. If you don't know; I create content about retro games (woah what a shocker, amirite), and 
                mostly focus on getting achievements via the site RetroAchievements. Even though in my last sentence I literally
                said I create videos on retro games, I wouldn't say I have a label - I'd at most call myself a challenge YouTuber.
                Retro games are my primary source of enjoyment but that doesn't mean I only want to do videos on them. I despise
                self-imposed challenges, so if there's ever an ingame challenge, or set of challenges, on a video game I enjoy then there's
                a very high chance I'll eventually do a video on it.
            </p>
            <p>Besides YouTube, I love playing and getting good at joke/bad games (Garfield Kart, Coffin Dodgers, Nickelodeon
                All-Star Brawl, etc) and listen to a LOT of music. Like, a conercing amount of music. In 2024 I listened to about
                850 hours of music. If I can do something while listening to music, you bet I'm doing just that. From writing scripts, 
                editing videos, programming, surfing the web, and playing games; I am always listening to my favourite artists.
            </p>
            <p>And that's it, really. I'm a pretty boring person to most people. I don't like watching shows or movies, nor do I 
                consume that much YouTube. When I do, it's usually to support my YouTuber buddies or to watch a tutorial on how to center
                a div. I don't use social media that much, apart from Bluesky, where I mostly post updates on videos, and mostly
                spend my time studying or editing - I dedicate at most 1 hour to video games, although that measurement isn't always
                accurate as on some days, especially school breaks or when I have less work, the number goes up. I would like to yap 
                more, but I want to keep my site clean lmao. 
            </p>
