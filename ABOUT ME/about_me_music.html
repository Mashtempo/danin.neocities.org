        <h1>I like music.</h1>
        <div class="about-me">
            <p>Like, a LOT. I've always had an insane obsession with music, and listen to a lot of music every day. When I'm 
                bored, when I'm playing games (depends, anything that isn't going to be used for a video, not only because I 
                need the game's OST but also a clean recording of the capture), when I'm writing scripts, when I'm editing, 
                when I'm studying... I'm sure you get the idea. 
            </p>
            <p>My music taste is <b>complicated.</b> Throughout my lifetime I've had a lot of friends who enjoy all kinds 
                of genres, and I like having healthy discussions about music, so I would usually listen to what they like 
                to engage in conversations about that genre/artist. This led me to listening to a LOT of genres. To say that 
                I listen to everything is a bit far-fetched (and untrue), but I like <b>most</b> stuff. This is gonna be my 
                general talk about my music taste, but if you wanna see more check out my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Boofny" target="_blank">last.fm.</a>
            </p>
            <p>My "main" genres tend to change a lot, but anything that's loud/harsh/heavy I absolutely love. I inject that 
                type of music in my fucking bloodstream. I LOVE dark trap, trap metal, deathcore, and post-hardcore. I love rap and 
                heavy elements of metal, and having that combined into one genre is absolute bliss. It does sound funny but it helps me 
                relax and concetrate, plus the beats are fucking sick. My favourite artists are Istasha, Grim Salvo (and by extension,
                Mossback), Witchouse 40k, Twentythree, do not resurrect, Savage Ga$p, Scarlxrd, and many, many more. Honorable mentions 
                are Faceless 1-7, Corpse, Ghostemane, Muppy, $uicideboy$, and every other artist that I don't listen to that much. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you take a look at my last.fm, you might notice a giant fucking list of artists, all with different genres. I have 
                days where I'll take a break from listening to trap/metal and listen to something completely unrelated. You might notice that 
                breakcore, speedcore and other adjacent genres come up most. I used to play a lot of VSRGs (vertical scrolling rhythm games) and 
                people tend to chart songs in those genres because the BPM is high and the charters can make some absolutely fucked patterns, so 
                I got used to the music and started to enjoy it. I listen(ed) mostly to Kobaryo, t+pazolite, and Camellia. I enjoy calmer breakcore 
                so I used it as background noise while working. I don't want to associate myself with these genres of music anymore, sounds stupid 
                but I want to distance myself from these genres (and any genre that wasn't introduced by my past friends) due to personal reasons.   
            </p>
            <p>I am not joking by the way, I listen to music while doing any type of work (well, except studying theory cause I can't 
                concetrate). But on every other occassion it helps me relax. If you go to my last.fm profile, you might see that 
                sometimes I listen to one song on repeat, like for a long time. No, those scrobbles aren't idled, or botted, or whatever 
                the term is, I am just insanely autistic. Well, whenever you see me do that, it means that I am working or studying. I found 
                out that I work the best when listening to something on repeat. I rarely play out an entire album or EP, but of course there are 
                exceptions. Oh and I have an insane obsession with hearting music, that's usually songs I ABSOLUTELY like and are usually 
                insanely replayed.
            </p>
            <p>And no, I won't share any playlist. Not because I gatekeep, but because I don't use them. I have them, but they're 
                made when I'm on a trip and don't have access to Spotify, so I put them all in a big playlist and download them. I 
                listen to albums and singles/E.Ps individually. 
            </p>
            <p>I could make a concrete list of my favourite artist, albums, songs, etc... But to be honest I would be just reciting my 
                last.fm stats. So, instead I'll list things that you should ABSOLUTELY listen to at least once in your lifetime.

                <div><p>Grim Salvo. They're currently my favourite group ever. They're dark trap artists, and I LOVE 
                    their lyricism. The word play, the emotions they express through their songs is immaculate. One of the rare 
                    artists that resonates with me, as I've gone through a lot of trauma and had really bad experiences in the past. 
                    VOIDSTâ˜…R is my favourite work of theirs, and I think it's honestly the album of the decade. They did an excellent 
                    job, along with my man Witchy, who even incorporates some of their style into his new single. You also should check out 
                    Mildred, their older album but just as amazing. The amount of times I listened to HEART OF DARKNESS is actually not okay. 
                    (I also don't listen on Spotify so the scrobbles are quite off).

                <div>
                    <p>Marrhat by Istasha. No joke this is my favourite song of all time. He usually has more melodic songs  
                    that he puts at the end of his albums and E.Ps, but honestly this one hits way different. The lyrics 
                    resonate you in a very particular way of which I cannot really explain. You can hear that he's been 
                    hurt, and every time I listen to this song it gives me goosebumps, it's beautiful. I would have a lot 
                    more plays on it but I am too scared to overplay it, it honestly means way too much to me. Every time I listen to 
                    Marrhat, I crank the volume up to max and just... sit back and listen. I usually do this when I'm under serious 
                    stress, and every time it worked flawlessly. If you're somehow reading Mathias, thank you for making music.
